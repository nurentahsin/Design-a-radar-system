The objective of this project is get us familiar with real life implementation of digital signal processing using MATLAB. In this open-ended project, we need to design a radar system
which has a pre determind singnal that transmits a short tone sound wave and receives a weak echo from a distant target and we have to calculate the time delay (the time needed to travel the 
sound which was transmitted from the transmitter to the target and then from the target to the receiver) of a Radar system theoretically.Since the echo will be masked and not detectable we 
are required to auto correlate the transmitted signal and the received signal to view the time delay of the echo from the auto correlated graph.
